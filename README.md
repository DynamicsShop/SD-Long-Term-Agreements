# SD-Long-Term-Agreements

---

## Welcome
SD Long Term Agreements extension allows you to set up Long Term Agreements, Over-riders, or Rebates, with your Customers and Suppliers in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Long Term Agreements (LTAs), Over-riders, and Rebates are used in situations where, for example, individual Customers buy products from your Company but the Head Office of these individual Customers has agreed and cleared the purchase of certain products.  The Customer's Head Office has an agreement that they will get a percentage of the price that is charged to the individual Customers. Your business would allocate off a percentage of the Sales Price to one side so, at the end of a defined period, the percentage can be allocated and paid off by your Company either to the individual Customer, to pass on to their Head Office, or directly to the Head Office itself.

## Key Features
- The concept of the Accrual is the process of allocating off a percentage of the Sales Value to one side continuously to allocate to a General Ledger account as part of a Long Term Agreement, Over-rider, or Rebate.
- The concept of the Settlement is the amount that is actually sent to the Customer (either the individual Customer or the Customer's Head Office) at the end of the agreement (generally at the end of the year).
